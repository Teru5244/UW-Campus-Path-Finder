# Create a graph
created graph g

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g

# Add two edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in g

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1 and n2
g contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in g are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in g are: n1(e2)

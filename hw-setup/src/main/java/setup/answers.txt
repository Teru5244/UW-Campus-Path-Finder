1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

In Fobonacci class, the code accidentally made 0 also included as the negative case and cause the test program report
wrong exceptions threw by the class function. After changed the
if (n <= 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(n + " is negative"); } code to
if (n < 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(n + " is negative"); } the problem is fixed.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

This is similar to the previous question, 0 is non-negative but the code accidentally made it negative. The expected
value of Fib(0) is 1 but here we got a negative exception. Since we already change the condition n <= 0 to n < 0 in the
previous question, we do not need to do anything more for here.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

For the inductive cases, the algorithm completely messed up the fibonacci algorithm. In the case we n >= 2, we need to
do the recursions for n - 1 and n - 2 and sum them up instead of subtract them. To fix this we can just simply change
return getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2); in the else to return getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2);, and change
the second condition from n <= 2 to n < 2;
